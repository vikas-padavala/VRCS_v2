this project is to create a live menu application that displays the menu items of a
small eatery

the website should display the avaliability of menu items like if the item is properly avaliable
or it is almost getting completed, the general public should simply see the status not the exact count
for example if the item produce on that day is 100 unites then the item should be displayed as avaliable
till the first 80 unites when the avaliable unites is down to 20 or less than 20 then it should be displayed
as "getting out of stock soon"

general public should be able to checkout the menu and the menu should get update automatically
the data on the screen should be updated for every few(tbd) seconds

admin users should be able to login, add menu items, set quantity for that day, as mentioned earlear if the stock
is down to last 20% only then it should be displayed as getting out of stock soon

once the item is completely exausted then it should display as "out of stock"

the admin users should have the ability to remove any menu items when ever they want

the admin user should have the ability to add items into the system, set these already added items on the menu with the quantity
update prices of the items, update quantity on the menu board
